## How it works

...

## Requirements

### Plan A. Windows/Linux (executable edition)

Nothing. Just download the executable file and run it.

### Plan B. Python (Any operating systems; Recommend if possible)

You can use BukkitGPT on any device with [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/).  

And you need to install the depencies with this command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

*(Make sure you have the [Python](https://www.python.org) environment installed on your computer)*
